============

Learn JavaScript/CoffeeScript by following along with Christian Johansen's book 'Test-Driven JavaScript Development'

Code from Chpt. 14, Server-Side JavaScript with Node.js

Hands down, the best and most important chapter of the book. Callbacks are refactored to promises. I used the Q promise library(in place of the one suggested in the book) and once I got the jist of async programming(which this chapter helps you with) I think I fell head over heals in love with the async paradigm. Just saying, if your new to JS and/or async programming, like TDD and perhaps want to make the jump to javascript programming professinally, this chapter is a must read. Don't read my code though, read the book!

On that note, if your reading this, stop and go code something that deals with communicating event loops. They're the bomb bro.
